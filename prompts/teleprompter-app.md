# Teleprompter App

- I want to build a teleprompter web app

- Most teleprompter apps have the issue that they are full of ads or are really difficult too
 handle. The teleprompter app that we are going to build shall be modern, minimalistic, and
 free of distractions. It's only purpose is to display a text on the screen as readable as possible

- The teleprompter app starts with an input text box that prompts the users to type or copy
 and paste their script in that box

- A button centered below that box with "Start the teleprompter" launches the teleprompter
 application

- Features of the teleprompter application:
- Play/Pause, indicated by a button
- A slider for the size of the text in px
- A slider for the margin with 0% to 40% (0% uses the full width of the screen, 40% uses
   just the center of the screen)
- A slider for the rolling speed
- An icon to either align the text to the center or to the left
- A switch to choose the background color between black and white. With a black
   background, the text font is white. With a white background, the text font is black.
   Indicate the dark mode with a moon and the light mode with a sun.
- Important: All these features shall be handled from a navigation bar at the bottom of the
   screen. Most teleprompter web apps have the issue that they have the navigation bar at
   the top of the screen. Since most people use their built-in camera or a webcam that sits
   on top of the screen, this gives up valuable real estate between the camera and where
   your eyes are looking at to read the text. Therefore, place the navigation bar at the
   bottom of the screen, not at the top.
